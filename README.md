## Purpose
This project was to show the useage tableau. In this project we were able to show:
- line graphs
- map displays
- heat maps
- multiple filtering techniques
- story telling  

## Conclusion
The data shows a single month August in the year of 2019.  
Patterns showed a distict usage of both weekend and weekday usage.  
They also showed a significant diffrence in usage by subscribers over non subscribers.  

Possible follow up questions would be to compare usage in the winter, and to compare time usage of subscribers and non subscribers.
